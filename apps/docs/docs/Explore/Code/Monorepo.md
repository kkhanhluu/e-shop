# Monorepo

This monorepo is generated by [nx](https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro). Normally, nx is used to work with javascript/typescript projects. However there's also [community support](https://github.com/tinesoft/nxrocks/tree/develop/packages/nx-spring-boot) to get nx work with java spring boot

## Folder structure

```
+-- apps               # Most of the code lives in the `apps` folder
+-- libs               # Contains configuration and shared libs
+-- tools 			   # Scripts or generators for nx
```

All codes for microservices and api gateway are placed under `apps`. `libs` contains share `BOM` file for all java spring services, shared logic (i.e custom errors, error handling,...) and constants.
